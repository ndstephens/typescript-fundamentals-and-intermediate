# TypeScript Fundamentals and Intermediate TypeScript

These are my notes while taking the courses (taught by [Mike North](https://github.com/mike-north)) on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

The companion websites are excellent resources. Most of my notes here will be for:

- Additional information
- Further explanations
- Highlighting of things to remember
- Important and reusable examples
