# TypeScript Fundamentals and Intermediate TypeScript

These are my notes while taking the courses (taught by [Mike North](https://github.com/mike-north)) on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

The companion websites are excellent and the primary resource of information.

My notes here are basically for:

- Highlighting of things to remember
- Additional information and explanations
- Important and reusable examples
